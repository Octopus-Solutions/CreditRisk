# Introduction

  The datasets provided here are randomly generated to mimic the type
  of data that a bank might actually use. These random datasets allow
  the scripts to be run to replicate a real world process. A data
  scientist can replace these random datasets with their own data of
  the same form to initiate their machine learning.

  We have two versions of the datasets. The full datasets (listed
  below) are used for the blog post and are quite large, randomly
  generated but tuned to be reflective of real data. For the
  repository and to allow off-the-shelf repeatability we include a
  smaller sample of just 10,000 observtaions from the same
  datasets. Processing time is reduced from many hours to within
  minutes but the results can not be expected to be as comprehensive
  and predictive as with the larger dataset.

# Description of the larger example data sets

* The simulated transaction dataset contains 198,576 records and 11
  variables. The columns of “transactionID” and
  “accountID” are identifiers at transaction level and account
  level, respectively. Each account may have more than one transaction
  occurring at different times. These transactions record information
  about the transaction amount, transaction type, location, merchant
  and so on.

* The simulated demographic dataset contains 184,254 records with 9
  variables. It has a common key, “accountID”, with the
  transaction data. The column of “badFlag” is the label of
  customers or accounts (assuming one customer one account),
  representing their default status. The other variables show
  information about the characteristic of customers (e.g., age,
  education, income) and bank account information (e.g., credit
  limit).

* The simulated processed dataset is generated from the first script
  as a join of the above two datasets.
